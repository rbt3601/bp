Feature: Blood pressure category classification
  As a user
  I want to check my blood pressure category
  So that I can understand my health condition

  Scenario: Ideal blood pressure
    Given the systolic value is 110
    And the diastolic value is 70
    When I calculate the blood pressure category
    Then the result should be "Ideal Blood Pressure"

  Scenario: Low blood pressure
    Given the systolic value is 85
    And the diastolic value is 55
    When I calculate the blood pressure category
    Then the result should be "Low Blood Pressure"

  Scenario: High blood pressure
    Given the systolic value is 150
    And the diastolic value is 95
    When I calculate the blood pressure category
    Then the result should be "High Blood Pressure"

  Scenario: Invalid blood pressure (diastolic >= systolic)
    Given the systolic value is 100
    And the diastolic value is 120
    When I calculate the blood pressure category
    Then an error should be thrown
